RELEASE NOTES
=============

v0.34
-----------------------
- Fix a compiler warning -Wformat-zero-length string 


v0.33
-----------------------
- Fixes a slight screen corruption on 80 column display. When highlighting the verify ones option the first two digits of DoD 5220.20-M disappear. This patch fixes that issue.@PartialVolume #348 
- For some controllers/drivers the readlink method of obtaining the bus type for GUI display does not work. If we haven't already resolved the bus type, we then also check smartctl for the transport protocol for SAS. @PartialVolume #350 
- Check smartctl for unresolved bus types SATA  @PartialVolume #358 
- Changed message from (No ATA pass-thru) to (S/N: unknown) as the reason the serial number is unknown is because there is no ATA pass through for the chipset being used by the USB to SATA adapter, basically we are making the message more meaningful for the end user rather than for the engineer/programmer that may understand the previous terminology used. @PartialVolume @Firminator #356 
- Add drive temperature monitoring and display temperature in degrees Celsius in the GUI. Requires the kernel drivetemp module and makes use of the hwmon sub system in the kernel to extract drive temperatures. Nwipe will automatically load the drivetemp module if it's available. @PartialVolume #360 #361 #364
- Remove /dev/ from gui for long device names. This fixes column alignment issues in the gui with nvme drives i.e. nvme0n1 etc. If the drive name including path exceeds 8 characters the /dev/ is removed and prefixed with spaces to a total max length of 8 characters. @PartialVolume #365 
- Add -q --quiet option - anonymize serial numbers and SMBIOS-DMI data. This anonymizes serial numbers and related identifiable information for drives and hardware but does not remove model information in both the GUI and the log displayed by stdout at the end of a wipe and also in the log file if enabled in options. This feature is useful for uploading logs when submitting bug reports. @PartialVolume #366 #367 #371 #379 #383 
- Fixes a intermittent FAILED message that is displayed in the summary table when the message should have been UABORTED. The incorrect FAILED message only occurred when using control-C to abort a wipe. @PartialVolume #373 
- When many verification or pass errors are detected the status line can wrap on a 80 column display. This patch makes the error message more succinct which will free up about 10 characters & prevents the line wrapping. @PartialVolume #374 
- Fixes a problem that occurs with a unresponsive drive that causes the ETA to grow to an enormous value. We now do not calculate an individual drives ETA  when the throughput of the drive is zero so avoiding the overall ETA being incorrect for drives that are working correctly when multiple drives are being simultaneously wiped. While a individual drives ETA is calculated it is not displayed but only used to determine the overall ETA when all drives have completed. @PartialVolume #375 
- Add temperature monitoring and display with NVMe drives. @PartialVolume #377 #380 #381 
- When one of the two verify only methods are selected change the drive selected text from WIPE to VRFY to indicate the drive is not being wiped, but is only being verified. @PartialVolume  #378 
- Fixes a incorrect sector, block and device sizes in 32 bit builds only as displayed in the nwipe log. This problem had no affect on the wipe as the issue was caused by a incorrect format specifier that affected the log text only. @PartialVolume #387 #388 
- Fixes a issue where temperatures may not have been available on Debian systems due to the location of modprobe. Particularly relevant to Debian which when logged in as root doesn't put /sbin in the $PATH environment setting. This issue was not necessarily relevant for Linux distros based on Debian, for instance, Ubuntu where nwipe would have found the modprobe command. @PartialVolume #390 #391 
- Improve wipe thread cancellation error checking. @PartialVolume #392 
- Improve GUI thread messaging if a pthread_join fails. @PartialVolume #393 
- Fixed a missing serial number on SAS drive.@PartialVolume  #394 
- Added ISAAC-64 for 64 bit systems. Thanks @chkboom #398 #401 
- Fixes a problem with the Gutmann wipe where the random passes at the beginning and end were being re-arranged when only the inner passes should be rearranged. Thanks @chkboom #399
- Fixes a obscure incorrect summary table status, while the log text correctly reports the failure. If the drive becomes non responsive during the wipe, the MB/s throughput will slowly drop towards 0MB/s and will display a FAILURE -1 error. The logs will correctly display errors and nwipe's return status will be non zero, however the summary table may display erased rather than FAILURE, this is because
the wipe thread exited prematurely without setting the pass error. This fixes the error by checking the context's result status, i.e non zero on failure and if pass equals zero it makes pass equal to one. This is then picked up by the summary table log code which then marks the status
correctly as FAILURE in the summary table. @PartialVolume #400 
- Fixes a spurious message on abort before wipe.This patch fixes a minor display issue that occurs when a user aborts a wipe before a wipe has started. It only occurs if the user had selected one or more drives for wipe and then aborted before starting the wipe. The spurious message only occurs in a virtual terminal, i.e. /dev/tty1, /dev/tty2, /dev/console It does not occur in terminal applications such as konsole, xterm, terminator etc. The spurious message that appears in the main window, states that "/dev/sdxyz 100% complete" along with garbage values in the statistics window. The message appears for a fraction of a second before being replaced with the textual log information that correctly states that the user aborted and no wipe was started. Basically the gui status information update function tries to update the data when the wipe hasn't even started. The fix is to only update the statistics information only if a wipe has started by checking the 'global_wipe_status' value which indicates whether any wipe started. '1' indicates that a wipe has started, else '0' if no wipe has started. @PartialVolume #406 
- Fixes temperature update in drive selection window. This fixes a problem where the drive temperature is not updated
automatically in only the drive selection window. The temperature is however updated correctly every 60 seconds during a wipe in the wipe status window. This bug would probably never be noticed by most people as usually the drive temperature changes slowly and only rises once a wipe has started. The only time I imagine it would have been noticed would have been if the drive temperature was already high and you were trying to reduce the temperature by cooling before starting a wipe. This has now been corrected so that the temperature in the drive
selection window is updated every 60 seconds. @PartialVolume #407 
- Fixes a zombie nwipe process running at 100% CPU on one core but only on a Konsole based terminal. This only occurred when the Konsole terminal is exited while nwipe is sitting at the drive selection screen but nwipe did not exit when the konsole terminal was closed. If nwipe is exited normally on completion of a wipe or aborted by using control C then this problem would not be seen. Also occurs during a wipe if the konsole terminal is closed without exiting nwipe first, again only on Konsole based terminals. @PartialVolume #408 #409 
- Fixes a obscure segfault when --logfile option used with a non writable directory. @PartialVolume #410 


v0.32
-----------------------
- Add ones (0xFF) wipe to the methods. Renamed Zero Fill to Fill with Zeros and the new ones wipe, is called Fill with Ones.
- Add ones verication to the methods. Renamed Verify Blank to Verify Zeros (0x00) and the new verification is called Verify Ones (0xFF).
- Move method information from below the list of methods to the right of the method list. This allows better use of the screen space by allowing more methods to be added to the list, especially relevant to nwipe running as a standalone application on small distros such as shredos 2020 in frame buffer mode.
- Removed the old DBAN syslinux.cfg configuration hints as not relevant to nwipe. See nwipe --help or man nwipe for command line options.
- Add fdatasync errors to the error summary table.
- During a wipe, you can now toggle between dark screen, blank screen and default blue screen by repeatedly pressing the b key. Dark screen, which is grey text on black background has been introduced to prevent TFT/LCD image persistence on monitors that are sensitive to that issue.

v0.31
-----------------------
- Blanking disabled in GUI for OPS2 (mandatory requirement of standard). [#326](https://github.com/martijnvanbrummelen/nwipe/pull/326)
- Total bytes written/read for ALL passes or verifications are now logged. [#326](https://github.com/martijnvanbrummelen/nwipe/pull/326)
- Final blanking being enabled is no longer required for verification passes. GUI Fix. [#326](https://github.com/martijnvanbrummelen/nwipe/pull/326)
- Add a summary table to the log that shows totals for pass & verification errors. [#325](https://github.com/martijnvanbrummelen/nwipe/pull/325)
- Fix the missing 'Verifying' message on final blanking. [#324](https://github.com/martijnvanbrummelen/nwipe/pull/324)
- Fix prng selection always using mersenne irrespective of whatever prng the user selected. [#323](https://github.com/martijnvanbrummelen/nwipe/pull/323)

v0.30
-----------------------
- Add auto power off option on completion of wipe ( --autopoweroff ) (Thanks PartialVolume)
- Fixed --nowait option that wasn't working. (Thanks PartialVolume)
- Add verbose option. -v, --verbose.
- Add a spinner to the GUI for each drive being wiped. When nwipe is syncing the percentage completion pauses, having a spinner gives a clear indication that the wipe is still running. Each devices spinner disappears on completion of a given devices wipe. (Thanks PartialVolume)
- Make log messages, especially the ones with the tag 'notice' succinct and less than 80 characters including the timestamp. This is of more importance when nwipe is used on a 80x30 terminal (ALT-F2, Shredos etc) but generally makes the logs more readable. While doing this all information was still retained. (Thanks PartialVolume)
- Add a summary table to the log that shows each drives status, i.e. erased or failed, throughput, duration of wipe, model, serial no etc. In particular it benefits those that wipe many drives simultaneously in rack servers. At a glance any failed drives can be seen without having to browse back through the log. (Thanks PartialVolume)
- Add ETA to --nogui wipes status when SIGUSR1 (kill -s USR1 (nwipes PID) is issued on the command line.
- Fixed misleading throughput calculation. Throughput now shows average throughput calculated from start of wipe.
- Fixed system info not being displayed in Debian Sid. [#229](https://github.com/martijnvanbrummelen/nwipe/issues/229) (Thanks PartialVolume)
- Add serial number display for USB to IDE/SATA adapters. This only works if the USB to IDE/SATA adapter supports ATA pass through. See [#149](https://github.com/martijnvanbrummelen/nwipe/issues/149) for further details (Thanks PartialVolume)
- Fixed disk capacity nomenclature, width and padding on drive selection screen. See [#237](https://github.com/martijnvanbrummelen/nwipe/issues/237) (Thanks PartialVolume)
- Add bus type, ATA or USB, amongst others to drive selection and wipe windows. (Thanks PartialVolume)
- Add --nousb option. If you use the option --nousb, all USB devices will be ignored. They won't show up in the GUI and they won't be wiped if you use the --nogui --autonuke command. They will even be ignored if you specifically name them on the command line.
- Miscellaneous GUI fixes, throughput display format, percentage display format to improve column alignment when wiping multiple discs. (Thanks PartialVolume)
- Improve visibility of failure messages with red text on white background. (Thanks PartialVolume)
- Add NVME and VIRT (loop etc) devices to device type table for display in GUI and logs. NVME devices now show up as NVME devices rather than UNK (Thanks PartialVolume)
- Fixed very obscure segmentation fault going back to at least 0.24 in drive selection window when resizing terminal vertical axis while drive focus symbol '>' is pointing to the last drive of a multi drive selection window. See [#248](https://github.com/martijnvanbrummelen/nwipe/pull/248) for further details (Thanks PartialVolume)
- Warn the user if they are incorrectly typing a lower case s to start a wipe, when they should be typing a capital S [#262](https://github.com/martijnvanbrummelen/nwipe/issues/262) (Thanks PartialVolume)
- Warn the user if they are typing capital S in order to start a wipe but haven't yet selected any drives for wiping [#261](https://github.com/martijnvanbrummelen/nwipe/issues/261) (Thanks PartialVolume)
- Add ctrl A that toggles drive selection, all drives selected for wipe or all drives deselected. [#266](https://github.com/martijnvanbrummelen/nwipe/issues/266)
- Fixed compilation issue with NixOS with broken musl libc error due to missing header [#275](https://github.com/martijnvanbrummelen/nwipe/issues/275)
- Fixed status bar message showing incorrect information [#287](https://github.com/martijnvanbrummelen/nwipe/issues/287)
- Right Justify log labels to maintain column alignment [#280](https://github.com/martijnvanbrummelen/nwipe/issues/280)
- Added nwipe version & OS info to log [#297](https://github.com/martijnvanbrummelen/nwipe/pull/297)

v0.28
-----------------------
- Fixed premature exit when terminal resized on completion of wipes (Thanks PartialVolume)
- Fixed GUI when terminal is resized, currently not handled correctly causing missing or incorrectly sized ncurses windows/panels (Thanks PartialVolume)
- Fixed GUI screen flicker under various situations. [#200](https://github.com/martijnvanbrummelen/nwipe/pull/200) Fixes [#115](https://github.com/martijnvanbrummelen/nwipe/issues/115) (Thanks PartialVolume)
- Fixed responsivness of screen during wipe when resized. Info is updated every 10th/sec. Key presses are more responsive. (Thanks PartialVolume)
- Fixed compiler warning regarding buffer overflow. Fixes [#202](https://github.com/martijnvanbrummelen/nwipe/issues/202) (Thanks PartialVolume)
- Fixed Man page (Thanks martijnvanbrummelen)
- Fixed individual device throughput. On completion of a wipe instead of the throughput calculation stopping for a completed wipe, it would continue to calculate resulting in a particular drives throughtput slowly dropping until eventually it reached zero. The overall throughput was not affected. (Thanks PartialVolume)

v0.27
-----------------------
- Add `verify` method to verify a disk is zero filled [#128](https://github.com/martijnvanbrummelen/nwipe/pull/128) (Thanks Legogizmo)
- Add new HMG IS5 enhanced wipe method [#168](https://github.com/martijnvanbrummelen/nwipe/pull/168) (Thanks infrastation)
- Fixed percentage progress and show on completion of wipe (Thanks PartialVolume)
- Implement clang-format support (Thanks louib)
- Implement more frequent disk sync support (Thanks Legogizmo)
- Format command line help to 80 character line length [#114](https://github.com/martijnvanbrummelen/nwipe/pull/114) (Thanks PartialVolume)
