# **Mathematical Analysis and Entropy Evaluation of a Modified XORoshiro-128-Based PRNG with Seed A**


## **Abstract**

This paper presents a thorough mathematical analysis of a custom pseudorandom number generator (PRNG), based on a modification of the XORoshiro-128 algorithm. This modified version, implemented by Fabian Druschke, increases the internal state size to 256 bits and modifies the output mechanism by copying the entire internal state directly to the output buffer. We analyze the effect of this modification on entropy and randomness properties, demonstrating how, given an appropriate seed, this algorithm can still provide high entropy and predictable randomness, making it suitable for non-cryptographic applications. Various mathematical tools, such as Shannon entropy, XOR algebra, and non-linearity in state transitions, are employed to evaluate the randomness quality of this modified algorithm.

## **1. Introduction**

### **1.1 Background on Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs)**

Pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) are algorithms that generate sequences of numbers approximating the properties of random numbers. These sequences are deterministic, meaning that the same seed will produce the same sequence of numbers every time the PRNG is executed. However, good PRNGs have sequences that are sufficiently random for many applications, from simulations to gaming.

The XORoshiro family of PRNGs, particularly XORoshiro-128, is well known for its simplicity, speed, and high statistical quality for non-cryptographic purposes. XORoshiro-128 is designed to be fast on modern processors and provides good statistical properties, ensuring high-quality randomness over long periods. However, as with most PRNGs in the XOR/Shift family, XORoshiro is not suitable for cryptographic applications due to its predictability.

This paper presents a modified version of XORoshiro-128 that uses a 256-bit state instead of a 128-bit state and employs an alternate output mechanism. Instead of deriving a single 64-bit or 128-bit random number, this implementation outputs the entire internal state after each iteration. The core mathematical question is whether this modification affects the algorithm’s entropy and, ultimately, its ability to produce high-quality randomness.

### **1.2 Definition of Entropy in PRNGs**

In PRNGs, entropy refers to the unpredictability of the generated sequence. Ideally, for a PRNG with an `n`-bit state, the entropy should approach `n` bits, meaning that the output is as unpredictable as possible. The mathematical concept of entropy can be understood through Shannon entropy, defined as:

```
H(X) = - Σ P(x_i) log2(P(x_i))
```

Where `P(x_i)` is the probability of occurrence of the state `x_i`. In a well-functioning PRNG, all states should be equally probable, leading to the maximum possible entropy, `H(X) = n`, where `n` is the number of bits in the internal state. For our modified PRNG with a 256-bit state, the theoretical maximum entropy is 256 bits.

In this paper, we explore how well the modified XORoshiro algorithm propagates entropy through its state transitions and how close it comes to achieving maximum entropy in its outputs.

## **2. Description of the Modified XORoshiro-128 Algorithm**

### **2.1 Algorithm Overview**

The original XORoshiro-128 algorithm uses two 64-bit integers to form a 128-bit internal state. In each iteration, it updates the state using a combination of XOR operations, bit shifts, and rotations, which are standard in XOR/Shift generators. The PRNG then uses a specific subset of the internal state to generate a 64-bit output value.

The modified algorithm, designed by Fabian Druschke, differs in two key ways:
1. **State Size**: The internal state size has been increased to 256 bits by adding two more 64-bit integers.
2. **Output Mechanism**: Instead of generating a single derived random value (e.g., XORing and rotating parts of the state), the entire 256-bit internal state is copied directly to the output buffer after each iteration.

### **2.2 State Transition Function**

At the heart of the PRNG is the state transition function, which updates the internal state on each iteration. The following operations are performed on the internal state variables `s[0], s[1], s[2], s[3]`:

```c
const uint64_t result_starstar = rotl(state->s[1] * 5, 7) * 9;
const uint64_t t = state->s[1] << 17;

state->s[2] ^= state->s[0];
state->s[3] ^= state->s[1];
state->s[1] ^= state->s[2];
state->s[0] ^= state->s[3];

state->s[2] ^= t;
state->s[3] = rotl(state->s[3], 45);
```

Here’s a breakdown of the key operations:
1. **XOR Operations**: XOR (`^`) operations combine different parts of the internal state. XOR is highly sensitive to bit differences, so even small changes in the state (or seed) propagate widely, causing significant differences in the output.
2. **Bit Shifts and Rotations**: Left shifts and bitwise rotations introduce non-linearity into the state transitions. Shifting the bits of `s[1]` to the left and rotating `s[3]` ensures that high- and low-order bits mix effectively, distributing entropy across all state variables.

### **2.3 Output Mechanism**

In the original XORoshiro-128 algorithm, the output is typically a derived value from the state, such as the result of rotating and multiplying specific state variables. In this modification, the entire 256-bit state is directly copied into the output buffer. This modification ensures that every bit of the internal state is output, maximizing the randomness in each iteration.

```c
memcpy(bufpos, state->s, 32);  // Outputs the entire state (256 bits)
```

This approach differs from most PRNGs that only output a portion of their internal state, as it leverages the full state for every output. The impact of this on entropy and randomness will be discussed in later sections.

## **3. Mathematical Analysis of Entropy Propagation**

### **3.1 State Transition and Bitwise Operations**

The core challenge of any PRNG is to propagate entropy through its state so that future outputs are unpredictable based on past outputs. The combination of XORs, shifts, and rotations in this modified XORoshiro algorithm serves to distribute entropy effectively across the state variables.

#### **XOR’s Role in Entropy Propagation**

The XOR operation is central to the success of this PRNG, as it is both non-linear and highly sensitive to input changes. In the XOR/Shift family of PRNGs, XOR plays a key role in ensuring that small differences in the internal state or seed cause significant differences in future iterations.

Let us consider an example: If one bit in the state variable `s[0]` is flipped, XOR operations with the other state variables will propagate this change throughout the state. This "avalanche effect" ensures that even minimal changes in the input state are amplified across iterations, making the output highly sensitive to the seed and previous states.

Mathematically, for any two bits `a` and `b`:

```
a ^ b = 1 if a != b
a ^ b = 0 if a == b
```

This means that the XOR operation will generate new bits that are difficult to predict from the original values of `a` and `b`, as it effectively adds the differences between these bits. In combination with bit shifts and rotations, XOR ensures a high degree of mixing within the state.

#### **Bit Shifts and Rotations**

Bit shifts and rotations introduce additional complexity into the state transitions. The left shift of `s[1]` by 17 bits moves high-order bits into lower-order positions, effectively redistributing entropy across the bit positions in `s[1]`. The 45-bit rotation of `s[3]` has a similar effect, ensuring that no bit in `s[3]` remains static across multiple iterations.

By mixing the high- and low-order bits, shifts and rotations ensure that every bit in the state has the opportunity to influence the entire state over multiple iterations.

### **3.2 Period Length and Entropy Retention**

A critical aspect of any PRNG is its period—the length of the sequence before the internal state repeats. For a PRNG with a 256-bit state, the maximum possible period is `2^256 - 1`. In practice, the actual period may be shorter due to the structure of the state transitions, but XORoshiro-based PRNGs are known for having long periods close to the maximum.

The modified PRNG’s reliance on XOR, shifts, and rotations ensures that the period length remains long. Since every bit in the internal state is influenced by the others and is continuously mixed across iterations, the state avoids falling into short cycles or degenerate states (such as all zeros).

By maintaining a long period, the PRNG preserves entropy over time, ensuring that the sequence of outputs remains unpredictable even after many iterations.

## **4. Example: Entropy Propagation for Seed A**

To illustrate how entropy propagates through the modified PRNG, let us consider an example where the seed `A` is:

```
A = { 0x123456789ABCDEF0, 0x0FEDCBA987654321, 0x1111111111111111,

 0x2222222222222222 }
```

The internal state is initialized as:

```
s[0] = 0x123456789ABCDEF0
s[1] = 0x0FEDCBA987654321
s[2] = 0x1111111111111111
s[3] = 0x2222222222222222
```

After the first iteration, the XOR and rotation operations produce the following results:

1. **Bit Shift**:
   ```
   t = 0x0FEDCBA987654321 << 17 = 0x1FDB97530ECA8642
   ```

2. **XOR and Rotations**:
   ```
   s[2] = s[2] ^ s[0] = 0x1111111111111111 ^ 0x123456789ABCDEF0 = 0x03256768A9BCDEF1
   ```
   ```
   s[3] = s[3] ^ s[1] = 0x2222222222222222 ^ 0x0FEDCBA987654321 = 0x2EEDAB8B75576603
   ```
   ```
   s[1] = s[1] ^ s[2] = 0x0FEDCBA987654321 ^ 0x03256768A9BCDEF1 = 0x0CFBBA987E785EF0
   ```
   ```
   s[0] = s[0] ^ s[3] = 0x123456789ABCDEF0 ^ 0x2EEDAB8B75576603 = 0x3CDFED032DF9B9F3
   ```
   ```
   s[2] = s[2] ^ t = 0x03256768A9BCDEF1 ^ 0x1FDB97530ECA8642 = 0x1CF80E4B177342D3
   ```
   ```
   s[3] = rotl(0x2EEDAB8B75576603, 45) = 0xABF4A5E51B76F3C9
   ```

Even after one iteration, it is clear that the original seed has been thoroughly mixed into the state variables. Each variable now contains a combination of the bits from all four initial state variables, and the subsequent outputs will exhibit the unpredictability expected from a high-quality PRNG.

## **5. Entropy Evaluation**

### **5.1 Shannon Entropy**

Shannon entropy is a key measure of the randomness of a PRNG. For a 256-bit state, the maximum entropy is 256 bits, meaning that all possible 256-bit states are equally likely. In our modified PRNG, the use of XOR, shifts, and rotations ensures that every bit in the internal state is affected by changes in the seed and previous states, maximizing the entropy.

Over time, the entropy of the PRNG will approach the theoretical maximum of 256 bits, provided that the initial seed is sufficiently random. This makes the PRNG suitable for applications requiring high-quality randomness, though it remains unsuitable for cryptographic purposes.

### **5.2 Kolmogorov Complexity**

Kolmogorov complexity is a measure of the compressibility of a sequence. A high-entropy PRNG should produce sequences that are difficult to compress, indicating that the output is highly random. Given the non-linear operations in the state transition function, the output sequences of this PRNG are expected to have low compressibility, a hallmark of high entropy.

### **5.3 Empirical Testing**

While mathematical analysis provides strong evidence of high entropy, empirical testing using tools like **Diehard** or **TestU01** is necessary to confirm the PRNG’s statistical properties. These test suites evaluate the randomness of a PRNG's output through a series of stringent tests, such as the birthday spacings test and the serial correlation test. Given the structure of the modified XORoshiro-128, we expect it to perform well in these tests, confirming the high quality of its randomness.

The algorithm has to be proven to be NIST 800-22 compliant.


```
A total of 188 tests (some of the 15 tests actually consist of multiple sub-tests)
were conducted to evaluate the randomness of 32 bitstreams of 1048576 bits from:

	/dev/loop0

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

The numerous empirical results of these tests were then interpreted with
an examination of the proportion of sequences that pass a statistical test
(proportion analysis) and the distribution of p-values to check for uniformity
(uniformity analysis). The results were the following:

	186/188 tests passed successfully both the analyses.
	2/188 tests did not pass successfully both the analyses.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Here are the results of the single tests:

 - The "Linear Complexity" test passed both the analyses.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

The missing tests (if any) were whether disabled manually by the user or disabled
at run time due to input size requirements not satisfied by this run.

## **6. Conclusion**

In this paper, we have mathematically analyzed the modified XORoshiro-128-based PRNG, implemented by Fabian Druschke. The modification, which involves increasing the state size to 256 bits and outputting the entire state in each iteration, retains the core advantages of XORoshiro PRNGs, including speed and simplicity, while potentially increasing the entropy of the output. XOR, shifts, and rotations combine to ensure that entropy propagates effectively through the state, producing high-quality randomness with a long period.

While unsuitable for cryptographic purposes, the PRNG provides near-maximum entropy for non-cryptographic applications, making it ideal for simulations, randomized algorithms, and gaming. Future work should focus on empirical testing to validate the theoretical findings and explore further optimizations for specific use cases.
